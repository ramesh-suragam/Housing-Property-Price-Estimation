# Housing Property Price Estimation in Greater London

House price evaluation is an area in which the statistical analysis plays an important role. With the help of statistical exploratory analysis, we can create model which can help to predict the house price in an area and its neighbouring places. There is considerable public debate and concern over the affordability of house prices in London, and the potential risks of instability from the housing market. It looks at the fundamental processes that drive the market for buying and selling homes, considering the extent to which the observed changes in house prices are reasonable, and the possible long-term consequences of house price inflation for London but the sales came at the end of a decade when property prices had started to rise quickly following the deregulation of financial sector under Margaret Thatcher’s government and the passing of legislation allowing council tenants to buy their own council houses.

It presents the recent trends in the housing market, including a review of the data sources used and some of the limitations faced in producing the analysis. It then proceeds to analyse whether or not the evidence suggests house prices are in line with underlying economic ‘fundamentals’, based on a range of indicators. The data given to us is the subset of anonymised mortgage records for the area that is known as Greater London and is over 25 years old.

As a part of exploratory analyses there are different Machine Learning techniques available in R. The project will help to establish the strong relationships between the house price for greater London using the parameter such as the central heating, floor area, Garage availability in the house, location, number of bedroom available and house price of other borough as well. With this project, we aim to answer the below question.

•	Is floor area an important factor for house price?
•	Is central heating an important criterion when considering to buy a house in greater London? (since UK, is considered to a cold country)
•	Has the deregulation in the financial sector impacted other boroughs house price hike as well apart from London?
•	Is the age of the house an important criterion when considering to buy a house in London?
•	Is the availability of garage an important criterion when considering to buy a house in London?
•	Is the number of bedrooms in the house is considered while buying the house and if this is impacting the house price of the London.
